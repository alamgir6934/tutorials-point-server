You will learn how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments. This will help you to understand what is going on inside a particular built-in implementation of a data structure and what to expect "

In this course we will study fundamental algorithms for solving a variety of problems, including sorting, searching and graph algorithms. More importantly, we will focus on general design and analysis techniques that underlie these algorithms. For example, we will examine divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greediness, and probabilistic approaches. With an understanding of these techniques, you will be prepared to design some of your own algorithms."
